<h3>Welcome to Femme Health</h3>

<p>
Femme Health is a wellness-focused platform created to share
simple and practical tips for women who want to feel better
in their daily lives.
</p>

<p>
We believe that health starts with small daily habits.
From hydration to sleep quality, everything matters.
</p>

<h3>Why Wellness Matters</h3>

<p>
Modern life can be stressful. Long work hours, lack of sleep,
poor nutrition and emotional overload can affect your body
and mind.
</p>

<p>
That’s why taking care of yourself is not selfish — it’s necessary.
Your body deserves attention and care.
</p>

that supports women's wellness and daily energy.
